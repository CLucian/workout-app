  info:
    "The abdominal muscles form the anterior and lateral abdominal wall and consist of the external abdominal obliques, the internal abdominal obliques, the rectus abdominis and the transversus abdominis . Acting together these muscles form a firm wall that protects the viscera and they help to maintain erect posture. In addition the contraction of these muscles helps in expiration and to increase the intra-abdominal pressure such as in sneezing, coughing, lifting and childbirth.",
  muscleFunction:
    "Both sides acting together, the external abdominal obliques flex the vertebral column by drawing the pubis towards the xiphoid process. Acting unilaterally it results in ipsilateral side flexion and contralateral rotation of the trunk."

const bicepsSectionContent = {
  title: "Biceps Brachii",
  src: "exercise-images/muscle-category-images/biceps-muscles.jpg",
  info:
    "Commonly known as the biceps, is a two-headed muscle that lies on the upper arm between the shoulder and the elbow.",
  muscleFunction:
    "Flexes the shoulder joint. The short head assists with shoulder adduction. The long head may assist with abduction if the humerus is laterally rotated. With the origin fixed, flexes the elbow joint, moving the forearm toward the humerus and supinates the forearm. With the insertion fixed, flexes the elbow joint, moving the humerus toward the forearm, as in pull-up or chinning exercises."

  title: "Pectorals",

  info:
    "The pectoralis major is the most superficial muscle in the pectoral region. It is large and fan shaped, and is composed of a sternal head and a clavicular head. The pectoralis major is active in deep or forced inspiration, but not expiration. - The pectoralis minor is triangular in shape and is located under the pectoralis major, and both form the anterior wall of the axilla. The shortened , tight muscle can be easily palpated there. It is also located close in relation to the brachial plexus and both the subclavian artery and vein, which all run between the muscle and the rib cage. Pectorlis minor and coracoid process together form a bridge under which nerves and vessels go to he upper limb.",
  muscleFunction:
    "With the origin fixed, the pectoralis major adducts and medially rotates the humerus. With the insertion fixed, it may assist in elevating thorax, as in forced inspiration. In crunch-walking or parallel-bar work, it will assist in supporting the weight of the body. The primary actions of the pectoralis minor muscle includes the stabilization, depression, abduction or protraction, internal rotation and downward rotation of the scapula. It elevates the ribs for deep inspiration when the pectoral girdle is fixed or elevated. With the scapula stabilized, in a position of good alignment, the pectoralis minor acts as an accessory muscle of inspiration. When the ribs are immobilized, this muscle brings the scapula forward, Both pectoralis muscles work with the serratus anterior muscles to create full range of movement for the scapula."

const deltoidsSectionContent = {
  title: "Deltoids",
  src: "exercise-images/muscle-category-images/deltoid-muscles.jpg",
  info:
    "The Deltoid muscle is a large triangular shaped muscle which lies over the glenohumeral joint and which gives the shoulder its rounded contour. It is named after the Greek letter delta, which is shaped like an equilateral triangle. It comprises 3 distinct portions each of which produces a different movement of the glenohumeral joint, commonly named the anterior, mid (or lateral) and posterior heads.",
  muscleFunction:
    "An important function of deltoid is the prevention of subluxation or even dislocation of the head of the humerus particularly when carrying a load. Deltoid is the prime mover of shoulder abduction."

const calvesSectionContent = {
  title: "Calves",
  src: "exercise-images/muscle-category-images/calf-muscles.jpg",
  info:
    "The muscles within the calf correspond to the posterior compartment of the leg. The two largest muscles (soleus and gastrocnemius) within this compartment are known together as the calf muscle and attach to the heel via the achilles tendon. Several other smaller muscles attach to the knee and ankle and via long tendons to the toes.",
  muscleFunction:
    "Along with the soleus muscle, the gastrocnemius forms half of the calf muscle. Its function is plantar flexing the foot at the ankle joint and flexing the leg at the knee joint. The gastrocnemius is primarily involved in running, jumping and other 'quick' movements of the leg, and to a lesser degree in walking and standing. The soleus muscle on the other hand plays a significant role in pumping blood back up to the body and maintaining posture and balance."

const backSectionContent = {
  title: "Back",
  src: "exercise-images/muscle-category-images/back-muscles.jpg",
  info:
    "The back is composed of many layers of muscles. The combination of these muscles work together to support the trunk and hold the body upright. They also allow the trunk to move, twist and bend in multiple directions",
  muscleFunction:
    "These muscles help move the scapular in several directions and also hold it in place. They also help in vertebral column and thorax stabilization and respiration. The back muscles play an integral role in posture maintenance and help with general trunk movements"
};

const tricepsSectionContent = {
  title: "Triceps Brachii",
  src: "exercise-images/muscle-category-images/triceps-muscles.jpg",
  info:
    "The triceps brachii is the muscle that runs down the back of the humerus, which is the long bone of the upper arm, and ends at the top of the ulna, which is the long bone of the forearm. The triceps brachii gets its name because it contains three muscle 'heads' or points of origin. These include: Medial head, Lateral head, and Long Head",
  muscleFunction:
    "The triceps help in elbow joint extension and act as an antagonist to the biceps and brachialis. They also help stabilize the shoulder by keeping the humerus in the correct position in the shoulder joint."

const hamstringsSectionContent = {
  title: "Hamstrings",
  src: "exercise-images/muscle-category-images/hamstring-muscles.jpg",
  info:
    "The hamstrings are a group of three muscles which predominatly act to flex the knee. They are the Semitendinosus, Semimembranosus and Biceps Femoris",
  muscleFunction:
    "The hamstrings cross and act upon two joints, the hip and knee. They help extend the hip when the trunk is flexed and they also flex the knee inwardly and help rotate the lower leg when the knee is bent. These muscles play a crucial role in many daily activities such as walking, jumping, running and controlling some movements in the gluteus. They are most important as an antagonist to the quadriceps int he deceleration of knee extension"

const glutealsSectionContent = {
  title: "Gluteal Muscles",

  info:
    "The glute muscles are composed of three muscles: Gluteus maximus, medius and minimus. These muscles play a crucial role in most athletic endevours and are extremely powerful movers of the hip. They are characteristically built in a rounded shape.",
  muscleFunction:
    "The function of these muscles includes extension, abduction, lateral rotation and medial rotation of the hip joint."

    "The quads are a large muscle group that includes the four muscles of the front thigh. The quadriceps are composed of the Rectus femoris, Vastus lateralis, Vastus medialis and astus intermedius.",
  muscleFunction:
    "All four quadriceps are powerful extensors of the knee joint. They are crucial for walking, running, jumping and squatting. The quadriceps also play an important role in stabilizing the patella and knee joint during gait"
